	<h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
		<img src="img/alecpic.jpg" alt="Alec Pic" />
		<p>My name is Alec. I'm an NYC-based marketer, tech enthusiast, and budding developer, by way of Nashville, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. I love unplanned exploration, live music, great coffee, and finding creative solutions to boring problems.</p>

		<p class="years">April 2014 &nbsp - &nbsp Present</p>
		<br>
		<p>I'm currently on the growth marketing team at Squarespace, working to scale the business across new product lines and geographies. I manage the entire acquisition funnel for a number of our paid marketing channels, from radio and content marketing, to out of home and display advertising. At a high level, I strive to connect with new and emerging verticals of potential customers in meaningful and entertaining ways to demonstrate how a website could benefit their lives, hobbies, and careers!</p>

		<p class="years">August 2014 &nbsp - &nbsp Present</p>
		<br>
		<p>Letterly is a side project started by me and my girlfriend. We missed the feeling of receiving handwritten cards from friends and family, so set out to build a service that let anyone send handwritten cards from the comfort of their keyboard. We developed a simple e-commerce <a href="http://www.sendletterly.com">website</a> that let users pick one of our illustrated cards, input a message, and click send. Within a few days, the recipient would receive a real handwritten card in the mail (written either by us or one of our expert letterwriters on staff). It's been a wonderful experiment in product and web design, customer acquisition tactics, and building something meaningful from scratch! </p>

		<p class="years">September 2011 &nbsp - &nbsp March 2014</p>
		<br>
		<p>My first job out of college was with a management consulting firm called Accenture. I worked across a myriad of industries over my 3 years with the firm, from health care to banking. I focused on helping organizations streamline operational processes, minimize inefficient business practices, and manage organizational change smoothly. While I never felt a strong sense of passion for my job at Accenture, I did learn how to develop truly useful processes quickly and efficiently, which provided incredibly useful when joining a young company like Squarespace.</p>
